## Simple Bible: Privacy policy

Welcome to Simple Bible for Android!

This app will be available on Google Play soon.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that my app will not collect any personally identifiable information, besides the Advertising ID of your device (for serving the advertisements). All data (created by you (the user)) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

This app operates within the default permission, and we don't add any additional permissions to this app (Which can be proved by our AndroidManifest file).  


If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email , and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Seal Accessibility.
